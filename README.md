# Text-Mining
Sentiment analysis of tweets


This is my first repository in Github. The project is basically Opinion mining of tweets.

# The Training data Explanation:
I first compiled a full sentiment training data from the movie review, the twitter airline data, part of the tweets sentiments data, a subset of the yelp business review data and from positive words and negative words text and used it to create my training data. This data is in no way comprehensive as this is my own version.


# Testing data explanation
I wil be using a train test split to test my data


# Project explanation
I am trying to analyze the sentiments of tweets about the two main candidates in the upcoming February elections in Nigeria. For the purpose of this small project aimed at achieving proficiency in data science, I will be using just 2000 tweets per candidate. I scraped the tweets using the twitter tweepy module.
